With every dilution, though the colour\nbecomes light, it is still visible.\nThis experiment shows that just a few\ncrystals of potassium permanganate can\ncolour a large volume of water (about\n1000 L). So we conclude that there must be\nmillions of tiny particles in just one crystal\nof potassium permanganate, which keep\non dividing themselves into smaller and\nsmaller particles.\nThe same activity can be done using 2 mL\nof Dettol instead of potassium permanganate.\nThe smell can be detected even on\nrepeated dilution.\nThe particles of matter are very small –\nthey are small beyond our imagination!!!!\n1.2 Characteristics of Particles of\nMatter\n1.2.1 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE\nBETWEEN THEM\nIn activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles\nof sugar, salt, Dettol, or potassium\npermanganate got evenly distributed in water.\nSimilarly, when we make tea, coffee or\nlemonade (nimbu paani ), particles of one type\nof matter get into the spaces between particles\nof the other.

We can see that\nmatter around us exists in three different\nstates– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter.\nNow, let us study about the properties of\nthese three states of matter in detail.\n1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\nActivity _____________ 1.9\n•\nCollect the following articles — a pen,\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\nstick.\n•\nSketch the shape of the above articles\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\naround them.\n•\nDo all these have a definite shape,\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\n•\nWhat happens if they are hammered,\npulled or dropped?\n•\nAre these capable of diffusing into each\nother?\n•\nTry compressing them by applying\nforce. Are you able to compress them?\nAll the above are examples of solids. We\ncan observe that all these have a definite\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\nshape, so they are rigid.\nConsider the following:\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\na solid?\n(b) What about sugar and salt? When\nkept in different jars these take the\nshape of the jar. Are they solid?\n(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\nyet we are able to compress it. Why?\nAll the above are solids as:\n•\nA rubber band changes shape under\nforce and regains the same shape when\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\napplied, it breaks.\n•\nThe shape of each individual sugar or\nsalt crystal remains fixed, whether we\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\na jar.\n•\nA sponge has minute holes, in which\nair is trapped, when we press it, the air\nis expelled out and we are able to\ncompress it.\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE\nActivity _____________1.10\n•\nCollect the following:\n(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a\ncold drink.\n(b) containers of different shapes. Put\na 50 mL mark on these containers\nusing a measuring cylinder from\nthe laboratory.\n•\nWhat will happen if these liquids are\nspilt on the floor?\n•\nMeasure 50 mL of any one liquid and\ntransfer it into different containers one\nby one. Does the volume remain the\nsame?\n•\nDoes the shape of the liquid remain the\nsame ?\n•\nWhen you pour the liquid from one\ncontainer into another, does it flow\neasily?\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\nthe shape of the container in which they are\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\nRefer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we\nsaw that solids and liquids can diffuse into\nliquids. The gases from the atmosphere\ndiffuse and dissolve in water. These gases,\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\nand plants.\nAll living creatures need to breathe for\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can breathe\nunder water due to the presence of dissolved\noxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\nliquids.

Enquire from him how many\nballoons is he able to fill from one cylinder.\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder.\nActivity _____________1.11\n•\nTake three 100 mL syringes and close\ntheir nozzles by rubber corks, as\nshown in Fig.1.4.\n•\nRemove the pistons from all the\nsyringes.\n•\nLeaving one syringe untouched, fill\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\nin the third.\n•\nInsert the pistons back into the\nsyringes. You may apply some vaseline\non the pistons before inserting them\ninto the syringes for their smooth\nmovement.\n•\nNow, try to compress the content by\npushing the piston in each syringe.\nWe have observed that gases are highly\ncompressible as compared to solids and\nliquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\ncylinders is compressed gas. Compressed\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\nin vehicles. Due to its high compressibility,\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compressed\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\nWe come to know of what is being cooked\nin the kitchen without even entering there,\nby the smell that reaches our nostrils. How\ndoes this smell reach us? The particles of the\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\nspread from the kitchen, reach us and even\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\nrate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to\nhigh speed of particles and large space\nbetween them, gases show the property of\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\nother and also the walls of the container. The\npressure exerted by the gas is because of this\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit area\non the walls of the container.\nFig. 1.4\n•\nWhat do you observe? In which case\nwas the piston easily pushed in?\n•\nWhat do you infer from your\nobservations?\nFig.1.5: a, b and c show the magnified schematic\npictures of the three states of matter. The\nmotion of the particles can be seen and\ncompared in the three states of matter.\nReprint 2025-26",

The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder that we get in our home for cooking or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in cylinders is compressed gas. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days in vehicles. Due to its high compressibility, large volumes of a gas can be compressed into a small cylinder and transported easily. We come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering there, by the smell that reaches our nostrils. How does this smell reach us? The particles of the aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread from the kitchen, reach us and even farther away. The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds; compare this with the rate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to high speed of particles and large space between them, gases show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases. In the gaseous state, the particles move about randomly at high speed. Due to this random movement, the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container. The pressure exerted by the gas is because of this force exerted by gas particles per unit area on the walls of the container. Fig. 1.4"

Water, when left uncovered, slowly changes into vapour. Wet clothes dry up. What happens to water in the above two examples? We know that particles of matter are always moving and are never at rest. At a given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there are particles with different amounts of kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour. This phenomenon of change of liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation."

The solute particles do not\nsettle down when left undisturbed, that\nis, a solution is stable.\n2.2.1 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION\nIn activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and\nB obtained different shades of solutions. So,\nwe understand that in a solution the relative\nproportion of the solute and solvent can be\nvaried. Depending upon the amount of solute\npresent in a solution, it can be called dilute,\nconcentrated or saturated solution. Dilute\nand concentrated are comparative terms. In\nactivity 2.2, the solution obtained by group\nA is dilute as compared to that obtained by\ngroup B.\nActivity ______________ 2.3\n•\nTake approximately 50 mL of water\neach in two separate beakers.\n•\nAdd salt in one beaker and sugar or\nbarium chloride in the second beaker\nwith continuous stirring.\n•\nWhen no more solute can be dissolved,\nheat the contents of the beaker to raise\nthe temperature by about 5oC.°\n•\nStart adding the solute again.\nIs the amount of salt and sugar or barium\nchloride, that can be dissolved in water at a\ngiven temperature, the same?\nAt any particular temperature, a solution\nthat has dissolved as much solute as it is\ncapable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated\nsolution. In other words, when no more solute\ncan be dissolved in a solution at a given\ntemperature, it is called a saturated solution.\nThe amount of the solute present in the\nsaturated solution at this temperature is called\nits solubility.\nIf the amount of solute contained in a\nsolution is less than the saturation level, it is\ncalled an unsaturated solution.\nWhat would happen if you were to take a\nsaturated solution at a certain temperature\nand cool it slowly.\nWe can infer from the above activity that\ndifferent substances in a given solvent have\ndifferent solubilities at the same temperature.\nThe concentration of a solution is the amount\n(mass or volume) of solute present in a given\namount (mass or volume) of solution.\nThere are various ways of expressing the\nconcentration of a solution, but here we will\nlearn only three methods.\n(i)\nMass by mass percentage of a solution\nMass of solute\n=\n×100\nMass of solution\nReprint 2025-26",

At any particular temperature, a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. In other words, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution. The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation level, it is called an unsaturated solution. What would happen if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly. We can infer from the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at the same temperature. The concentration of a solution is the amount (mass or volume) of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solution. There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will learn only three methods.

They can be\nseparated from the mixture by the\nprocess of filtration. When the particles\nsettle down, the suspension breaks and\nit does not scatter light any more.\n2.2.3 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?\nThe mixture obtained by group D in activity\n2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution.\nThe particles of a colloid are uniformly spread\nthroughout the solution. Due to the relatively\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\nhomogeneous.

    "raw_text": "uestions\n1.\nWhat are canal rays?\n2.\nIf an atom contains one electron\nand one proton, will it carry any\ncharge or not?\n4.2 The Structure of an Atom\nWe have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory in\nChapter 3, which suggested that the atom\nwas indivisible and indestructible. But the\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\n(electrons and protons) inside the atom, led\nto the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic\ntheory. It was then considered necessary to\nknow how electrons and protons are arranged\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\nscientists proposed various atomic models.\nJ.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\n4.2.1 THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\nThe electrons, in a sphere of positive charge,\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\nChristmas pudding. We can also think of a\nwatermelon, the positive charge in the atom\nis spread all over like the red edible part of\nthe watermelon, while the electrons are\nstudded in the positively charged sphere, like\nthe seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).\nThomson proposed that:\n(i)\nAn atom consists of a positively\ncharged sphere and the electrons are\nembedded in it.\n(ii)\nThe negative and positive charges are\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\nwhole is electrically neutral.\nAlthough Thomson’s model explained that\natoms are electrically neutral, the results of\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\nwill see below.\n4.2.2 RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM\nErnest Rutherford was interested in knowing\nhow the electrons are arranged within an\natom.

But the discovery of two fundamental particles (electrons and protons) inside the atom, led to the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom. For explaining this, many scientists proposed various atomic models. J.J.

The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We can also think of a watermelon, the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon, while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere, like the seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1). Thomson proposed that: (i) An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it. (ii) The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms are electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model, as we will see below."

But if a blind-folded child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them. Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford concluded from the α-particle scattering experiment that— (i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected. (ii) Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space. (iii) A very small fraction of α-particles were deflected by 1800, indicating that all the positive charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom. From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment, Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following features: (i) There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus. (ii) The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths. (iii) The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom.

(ii) An isotope of cobalt is used in the treatment of cancer. (iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the treatment of goitre."

    "raw_text": "SCIENCE\n\nThe movement of water across the plasma\nmembrane is also affected by the\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\nhigher solute concentration.\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\nin water?\nOne of the following three things could\nhappen:\n1.\nIf the medium surrounding the cell has\na higher water concentration than the\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypotonic solution.\nWater molecules are free to pass\nacross the cell membrane in both\ndirections, but more water will come\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\n(overall) result is that water enters the\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\n2.\nIf the medium has exactly the same\nwater concentration as the cell, there\nwill be no net movement of water across\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\nknown as an isotonic solution.\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\nboth directions, but the amount going\nin is the same as the amount going out,\nso there is no overall movement of\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\n3.\nIf \nthe \nmedium \nhas \na \nlower\nconcentration of water than the cell,\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\na hypertonic solution.\nAgain, water crosses the cell\nmembrane in both directions, but this\ntime more water leaves the cell than\nenters it. Therefore the cell will shrink.\nThus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\nNow let us try out the following activity:\nActivity ______________ 5.3\n(a)\nRemove the shell of an egg by\ndissolving it in dilute hydrochloric\nacid. The shell is mostly calcium\ncarbonate. A thin outer skin now\nencloses the egg. Put the egg in pure\nwater and observe after 5 minutes.\nWhat do we observe?\nThe egg swells because water passes\ninto it by osmosis.\n(b)\nPlace a similar de-shelled egg in a\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\nWater passes out of the egg solution\ninto the salt solution because the salt\nsolution is more concentrated.\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\nraisins or apricots.\nActivity ______________ 5.4\n•\nPut dried raisins or apricots in plain\nwater and leave them for some time.\nThen place them into a concentrated\nsolution of sugar or salt. You will\nobserve the following:\n(a)\nEach gains water and swells\nwhen placed in water.\n(b)\nHowever, when placed in the\nconcentrated solution it loses\nwater, and consequently shrinks.\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\nmost plant cells tend to gain water through\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots\nis also an example of osmosis.\nThus, diffusion is important in exhange\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\nnutrition from its environment. Different\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\nthrough a type of transport requiring use\nof energy.\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\nmade up of organic molecules called lipids\nand proteins. However, we can observe the\nstructure of the plasma membrane only\nthrough an electron microscope.\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\nmaterial from its external environment. Such\nprocesses are known as endocytosis. Amoeba\nacquires its food through such processes.\nReprint 2025-26",

Thus, osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity: Activity ______________ 5.3 (a) Remove the shell of an egg by dissolving it in dilute hydrochloric acid. The shell is mostly calcium carbonate. A thin outer skin now encloses the egg. Put the egg in pure water and observe after 5 minutes. What do we observe? The egg swells because water passes into it by osmosis. (b) Place a similar de-shelled egg in a concentrated salt solution and observe for 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solution into the salt solution because the salt solution is more concentrated. We can also try a similar activity with dried raisins or apricots.

You will observe the following: (a) Each gains water and swells when placed in water. (b) However, when placed in the concentrated solution it loses water, and consequently shrinks. Unicellular freshwater organisms and most plant cells tend to gain water through osmosis. Absorption of water by plant roots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, diffusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition from its environment. Different molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport requiring use of energy. The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins. However, we can observe the structure of the plasma membrane only through an electron microscope. The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes. Reprint 2025-26"

        "text": "From the last chapter, we recall that all living organisms are made of cells. In unicellular organisms, a single cell performs all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba, a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi- cellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour. Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue."

This aids in protection against loss of water, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi. Since it has a protective role to play, cells of epidermal tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces. Most epidermal cells are relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall. We can observe small pores here and there in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called guard cells. They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere. Transpiration (loss of water in the form of water vapour) also takes place through stomata. Reprint 2025-26"

Consider the\nmotion of an object moving along a straight\npath. The object starts its journey from O\nwhich is treated as its reference point\n(Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position\nof the object at different instants. At first, the\nobject moves through C and B and reaches A.\nThen it moves back along the same path and\nreaches C through B.\nare used to describe the overall motion of an\nobject and to locate its final position with\nreference to its initial position at a given time.\nActivity ______________ 7.3\n•\nTake a metre scale and a long rope.\n•\nWalk from one corner of a basket-ball\ncourt to its oppposite corner along its\nsides.\n•\nMeasure the distance covered by you\nand magnitude of the displacement.\n•\nWhat difference would you notice\nbetween the two in this case?\nActivity ______________ 7.4\n•\nAutomobiles are fitted with a device\nthat shows the distance travelled. Such\na device is known as an odometer. A\ncar is driven from Bhubaneshwar to\nNew Delhi. The difference between the\nfinal reading and the initial reading of\nthe odometer is 1850 km.\n•\nFind the magnitude of the displacement\nbetween Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi\nby using the Road Map of India.\nThe total path length covered by the object\nis OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km.\nThis is the distance covered by the object. To\ndescribe distance we need to specify only the\nnumerical value and not the direction of\nmotion. There are certain quantities which\nare described by specifying only their\nnumerical values. The numerical value of a\nphysical quantity is its magnitude. From this\nexample, can you find out the distance of the\nfinal position C of the object from the initial\nposition O? This difference will give you the\nnumerical value of the displacement of the\nobject from O to C through A. The shortest\ndistance measured from the initial to the final\nposition of an object is known as\nthe displacement.\nCan the magnitude of the displacement be\nequal to the distance travelled by an object?\nConsider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For\nmotion of the object from O to A, the distance\ncovered is 60 km and the magnitude of\ndisplacement is also 60 km. During its motion\nfrom O to A and back to B, the distance covered\nFig. 7.1: Positions of an object on a straight line path\n= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude\nof displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude\nof displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path\nlength (85 km). Further, we will notice that the\nmagnitude of the displacement for a course of\nmotion may be zero but the corresponding\ndistance covered is not zero. If we consider the\nobject to travel back to O, the final position\nconcides with the initial position, and therefore,\nthe displacement is zero. However, the distance\ncovered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +\n60 km = 120 km. Thus, two different physical\nquantities—the distance and the displacement,\nMOTION\n\nReprint 2025-26",

The total path length covered by the object is OA + AC, that is 60 km + 35 km = 95 km. This is the distance covered by the object. To describe distance we need to specify only the numerical value and not the direction of motion. There are certain quantities which are described by specifying only their numerical values. The numerical value of a physical quantity is its magnitude. From this example, can you find out the distance of the final position C of the object from the initial position O? This difference will give you the numerical value of the displacement of the object from O to C through A. The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement. Can the magnitude of the displacement be equal to the distance travelled by an object? Consider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For motion of the object from O to A, the distance covered is 60 km and the magnitude of displacement is also 60 km. During its motion from O to A and back to B, the distance covered Fig. 7.1: Positions of an object on a straight line path = 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude of displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path length (85 km). Further, we will notice that the magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding distance covered is not zero. If we consider the object to travel back to O, the final position concides with the initial position, and therefore, the displacement is zero. However, the distance covered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km +"

The rate at which objects move can\nbe different. Also, different objects can move\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\nin unit time. This quantity is referred to as\nspeed.

It can be changed\nby changing the object’s speed, direction of\nmotion or both. When an object is moving\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\ncan express the magnitude of its rate of\nmotion in terms of average velocity.

The area under the velocity-time graph gives the distance (magnitude of displacement) moved by the car in a given interval of time. If the car would have been moving with uniform velocity, the distance travelled by it would be represented by the area ABCD under the graph (Fig. 7.6).

If the hit is strong\nenough, the bottom coin moves out\nquickly. Once the lowest coin is\nremoved, the inertia of the other coins\nmakes them ‘fall’ vertically on the\ntable.\nGalileo Galilei was born\non 15 February 1564 in\nPisa, Italy. Galileo, right\nfrom his childhood, had\ninterest in mathematics\nand natural philosophy.\nBut \nhis \nfather\nVincenzo Galilei wanted\nhim to become a medical\ndoctor. \nAccordingly,\nGalileo enrolled himself\nfor a medical degree at the\nUniversity of Pisa in 1581 which he never\ncompleted because of his real interest in\nmathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first\nscientific book ‘The Little Balance [La\nBalancitta]’, in which he described\nArchimedes’ method of finding the relative\ndensities (or specific gravities) of substances\nusing a balance. In 1589, in his series of\nessays – De Motu, he presented his theories\nabout falling objects using an inclined plane\nto slow down the rate of descent.\nIn 1592, he was appointed professor of\nmathematics at the University of Padua in\nthe Republic of Venice. Here he continued his\nobservations on the theory of motion and\nthrough his study of inclined planes and the\npendulum, formulated the correct law for\nuniformly accelerated objects that the\ndistance the object moves is proportional to\nthe square of the time taken.\nGalileo was also a remarkable craftsman.\nHe developed a series of telescopes whose\noptical performance was much better than\nthat of other telescopes available during those\ndays. Around 1640, he designed the first\npendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry\nMessenger’ on his astronomical discoveries,\nGalileo claimed to have seen mountains on\nthe moon, the milky way made up of tiny\nstars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter.\nIn his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’\nand ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed\nhis observations of sunspots.\nUsing his own telescopes and through his\nobservations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo\nargued that all the planets must orbit the Sun\nand not the earth, contrary to what was\nbelieved at that time.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564 – 1642)\nFig. 8.6: Only the carom coin at the bottom of a\npile is removed when a fast moving carom\ncoin (or striker) hits it.\nReprint 2025-26",

An opposite experience is encountered when we are standing in a bus and the bus begins to move suddenly. Now we tend to fall backwards. This is because the sudden start of the bus brings motion to the bus as well as to our feet in contact with the floor of the bus. But the rest of our body opposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to continue in our straight-line motion. When an unbalanced force is applied by the engine to change the direction of motion of the motorcar, we slip to one side of the seat due to the inertia of our body. The fact that a body will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force can be illustrated through the following activities: Activity ______________ 8.1"

Once the lowest coin is removed, the inertia of the other coins makes them ‘fall’ vertically on the table. Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa, Italy. Galileo, right from his childhood, had interest in mathematics and natural philosophy. But his father Vincenzo Galilei wanted him to become a medical doctor. Accordingly, Galileo enrolled himself for a medical degree at the University of Pisa in 1581 which he never completed because of his real interest in mathematics. In 1586, he wrote his first scientific book ‘The Little Balance [La Balancitta]’, in which he described Archimedes’ method of finding the relative densities (or specific gravities) of substances using a balance. In 1589, in his series of essays – De Motu, he presented his theories about falling objects using an inclined plane to slow down the rate of descent. In 1592, he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Padua in the Republic of Venice. Here he continued his observations on the theory of motion and through his study of inclined planes and the pendulum, formulated the correct law for uniformly accelerated objects that the distance the object moves is proportional to the square of the time taken. Galileo was also a remarkable craftsman. He developed a series of telescopes whose optical performance was much better than that of other telescopes available during those days. Around 1640, he designed the first pendulum clock. In his book ‘Starry Messenger’ on his astronomical discoveries, Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on the moon, the milky way made up of tiny stars, and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter. In his books ‘Discourse on Floating Bodies’ and ‘Letters on the Sunspots’, he disclosed his observations of sunspots. Using his own telescopes and through his observations on Saturn and Venus, Galileo argued that all the planets must orbit the Sun and not the earth, contrary to what was believed at that time.

Calculate the force exerted by the brakes on the motorcar if its mass along with the passengers is 1000 kg. Solution: The initial velocity of the motorcar u = 108 km/h = 108 × 1000 m/(60 × 60 s) = 30 m s-1 and the final velocity of the motorcar v = 0 m s-1. The total mass of the motorcar along with its passengers = 1000 kg and the time taken to stop the motorcar, t = 4 s. From Eq. (8.5) we have the magnitude of the force (F) applied by the brakes as m(v – u)/t. On substituting the values, we get F = 1000 kg × (0 – 30) m s-1/4 s = – 7500 kg m s-2 or – 7500 N. The negative sign tells us that the force exerted by the brakes is opposite to the direction of motion of the motorcar. Example 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass m1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a mass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2. What acceleration would it give if both the masses were tied together? Solution: From Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and m2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2; a2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N. Thus, m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and m2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg. If the two masses were tied together, the total mass, m would be m = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The acceleration, a produced in the combined mass by the 5 N force would be, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2. Example 8.5 The velocity-time graph of a ball of mass 20 g moving along a straight line on a long table is given in Fig. 8.9. Fig. 8.9 How much force does the table exert on the ball to bring it to rest? Solution: The initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1. Due to the frictional force exerted by the table, the velocity of the ball decreases down to zero in 10 s. Thus, u = 20 cm s–1; v = 0 cm s-1 and t = 10 s. Since the velocity-time graph is a straight line, it is clear that the ball moves with a constant acceleration. The acceleration a is − = v u a t = (0 cm s-1 – 20 cm s-1)/10 s = –2 cm s-2 = –0.02 m s-2. Reprint 2025-26"

These two forces are always\nequal in magnitude but opposite in direction.\nThese forces act on different objects and never\non the same object. In the game of football\nsometimes we, while looking at the football\nand trying to kick it with a greater force,\ncollide with a player of the opposite team.\nBoth feel hurt because each applies a force\nto the other. In other words, there is a pair of\nforces and not just one force. The two\nopposing forces are also known as action and\nreaction forces.\nLet us consider two spring balances\nconnected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The\nfixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid\nsupport, like a wall. When a force is applied\nthrough the free end of spring balance A, it is\nobserved that both the spring balances show\nthe same readings on their scales. It means\nthat the force exerted by spring balance A on\nbalance B is equal but opposite in direction\nto the force exerted by the balance B on\nbalance A. Any of these two forces can be called\nas action and the other as reaction. This gives\nus an alternative statement of the third law of\nmotion i.e., to every action there is an equal\nand opposite reaction. However, it must be\nremembered that the action and reaction\nalways act on two different objects,\nsimultaneously.\nFig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and\nopposite.\nSuppose you are standing at rest and\nintend to start walking on a road. You must\naccelerate, and this requires a force in\naccordance with the second law of motion.\nWhich is this force? Is it the muscular effort\nyou exert on the road? Is it in the direction\nwe intend to move? No, you push the road\nbelow backwards. The road exerts an equal\nand opposite force on your feet to make you\nmove forward.\nIt is important to note that even though\nthe action and reaction forces are always\nequal in magnitude, these forces may not\nproduce accelerations of equal magnitudes.\nThis is because each force acts on a different\nobject that may have a different mass.\nWhen a gun is fired, it exerts a forward\nforce on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal\nand opposite force on the gun. This results in\nthe recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun\nhas a much greater mass than the bullet, the\nacceleration of the gun is much less than the\nacceleration of the bullet. The third law of\nmotion can also be illustrated when a sailor\njumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor\njumps forward, the force on the boat moves it\nbackwards (Fig. 8.12).\nFig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil\nof the gun.\nReprint 2025-26",

The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first. These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects and never on the same object. In the game of football sometimes we, while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a greater force, collide with a player of the opposite team. Both feel hurt because each applies a force to the other. In other words, there is a pair of forces and not just one force. The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces. Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support, like a wall. When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales. It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A. Any of these two forces can be called as action and the other as reaction. This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. However, it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects, simultaneously. Fig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite. Suppose you are standing at rest and intend to start walking on a road. You must accelerate, and this requires a force in accordance with the second law of motion. Which is this force? Is it the muscular effort you exert on the road? Is it in the direction we intend to move? No, you push the road below backwards. The road exerts an equal and opposite force on your feet to make you move forward. It is important to note that even though the action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude, these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes. This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass. When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it backwards (Fig. 8.12).

This force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational force."

In order to address these questions and understand the phenomena involved, it helps to introduce the concepts of the net force in a particular direction (thrust) and the force per unit area (pressure) acting on the object concerned. Let us try to understand the meanings of thrust and pressure by considering the following situations: Situation 1: You wish to fix a poster on a bulletin board, as shown in Fig 9.3. To do this task you will have to press drawing pins with your thumb. You apply a force on the surface area of the head of the pin. This force is directed perpendicular to the surface area of the board. This force acts on a smaller area at the tip of the pin."

Here the force is\nacting perpendicular to the surface of the sand.\nThe force acting on an object perpendicular to\nthe surface is called thrust.\nWhen you stand on loose sand, the force,\nthat is, the weight of your body is acting on\nan area equal to area of your feet. When you\nlie down, the same force acts on an area equal\nto the contact area of your whole body, which\nis larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the\neffects of forces of the same magnitude on\ndifferent areas are different. In the above\ncases, thrust is the same. But effects are\ndifferent. Therefore the effect of thrust\ndepends on the area on which it acts.\nThe effect of thrust on sand is larger while\nstanding than while lying. The thrust on unit\narea is called pressure. Thus,\nthrust\nPressure=\narea\n(9.20)\nSubstituting the SI unit of thrust and area in\nEq. (9.20), we get the SI unit of pressure as N/\nm2 or N m–2.\nIn honour of scientist Blaise Pascal, the\nSI unit of pressure is called pascal, denoted\nas Pa.\nLet us consider a numerical example to\nunderstand the effects of thrust acting on\ndifferent areas.\nExample 9.6 A block of wood is kept on a\ntabletop.

When you stand on loose sand, the force, that is, the weight of your body is acting on an area equal to area of your feet. When you lie down, the same force acts on an area equal to the contact area of your whole body, which is larger than the area of your feet. Thus, the effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different. In the above cases, thrust is the same. But effects are different. Therefore the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts. The effect of thrust on sand is larger while standing than while lying. The thrust on unit area is called pressure.

She reads books,\ndraws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\ndiscusses problems with her friends, and\nperforms experiments. She expends a lot of\nenergy on these activities. In common\nparlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard\nwork’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by\nthe scientific definition of work.\nYou are working hard to push a huge rock.\nLet us say the rock does not move despite all\nthe effort. You get completely exhausted.\nHowever, you have not done any work on the\nrock as there is no displacement of the rock.\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\nheavy load on your head. You get tired. You\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\nbit of your energy. Are you doing work on the\nload? The way we understand the term ‘work’\nin science, work is not done.\nYou climb up the steps of a staircase and\nreach the second floor of a building just to\nsee the landscape from there. You may even\nclimb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\na function are sometimes not considered to\nbe work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends\non the way we define it. We use and define\nthe term work differently in science.

We need energy for other activities like playing, singing, reading, writing, thinking, jumping, cycling and running. Activities that are strenuous require more energy. Animals too get engaged in activities. For example, they may jump and run. They have to fight, move away from enemies, find food or find a safe place to live. Also, we engage some animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull carts or plough fields. All such activities require energy. Think of machines. List the machines that you have come across. What do they need for their working? Why do some engines require fuel like petrol and diesel? Why do living beings and machines need energy?"

She reads books, draws diagrams, organises her thoughts, collects question papers, attends classes, discusses problems with her friends, and performs experiments. She expends a lot of energy on these activities. In common parlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard work’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by the scientific definition of work. You are working hard to push a huge rock. Let us say the rock does not move despite all the effort. You get completely exhausted. However, you have not done any work on the rock as there is no displacement of the rock. You stand still for a few minutes with a heavy load on your head. You get tired. You have exerted yourself and have spent quite a bit of your energy. Are you doing work on the load? The way we understand the term ‘work’ in science, work is not done. You climb up the steps of a staircase and reach the second floor of a building just to see the landscape from there. You may even climb up a tall tree. If we apply the scientific definition, these activities involve a lot of work. In day-to-day life, we consider any useful physical or mental labour as work. Activities like playing in a field, talking with friends, humming a tune, watching a movie, attending a function are sometimes not considered to be work. What constitutes ‘work’ depends on the way we define it. We use and define the term work differently in science. To understand this let us do the following activities: Activity _____________10.1"

We\nhave also observed children winding a toy\n(such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed\non the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon\nis filled with air and we press it we notice a\nchange in its shape. As long as we press it\ngently, it can come back to its original shape\nwhen the force is withdrawn. However, if we\npress the balloon hard, it can even explode\nproducing a blasting sound. In all these\nexamples, the objects acquire, through\ndifferent means, the capability of doing work.\nAn object having a capability to do work is\nsaid to possess energy. The object which does\nthe work loses energy and the object on which\nthe work is done gains energy.\nHow does an object with energy do work?\nAn object that possesses energy can exert a\nforce on another object. When this happens,\nenergy is transferred from the former to the\nlatter. The second object may move as it\nreceives energy and therefore do some work.\nThus, the first object had a capacity to do\nwork. This implies that any object that\npossesses energy can do work.\nThe energy possessed by an object is thus\nmeasured in terms of its capacity of doing\nwork. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same\nas that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the\nenergy required to do 1 joule of work.\nSometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo\njoule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J.\n10.2.1 FORMS OF ENERGY\nLuckily the world we live in provides energy in\nmany different forms. The various forms\ninclude mechanical energy (potential energy\n+ kinetic energy), heat energy, chemical\nenergy, electrical energy and light energy.\nThink it over !\nHow do you know that some entity is a\nform of energy?

        "text": "raised hammer falls on a nail placed on a piece of wood, it drives the nail into the wood. We have also observed children winding a toy (such as a toy car) and when the toy is placed on the floor, it starts moving. When a balloon is filled with air and we press it we notice a change in its shape. As long as we press it gently, it can come back to its original shape when the force is withdrawn. However, if we press the balloon hard, it can even explode producing a blasting sound. In all these examples, the objects acquire, through different means, the capability of doing work. An object having a capability to do work is said to possess energy. The object which does the work loses energy and the object on which the work is done gains energy. How does an object with energy do work? An object that possesses energy can exert a force on another object. When this happens, energy is transferred from the former to the latter. The second object may move as it receives energy and therefore do some work. Thus, the first object had a capacity to do work. This implies that any object that possesses energy can do work. The energy possessed by an object is thus measured in terms of its capacity of doing work. The unit of energy is, therefore, the same as that of work, that is, joule (J). 1 J is the energy required to do 1 joule of work. Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J."

The energy present in such an object is the gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential energy of an object at a point above the ground is defined as the work done in raising it from the ground to that point against gravity. It is easy to arrive at an expression for the gravitational potential energy of an object at a height. Fig. 10.7 Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be raised through a height, h from the ground. A force is required to do this. The minimum force required to raise the object is equal to the weight of the object, mg. The object gains energy equal to the work done on it.

What happens to the total\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\nenergy can only be converted from one form\nto another; it can neither be created or\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\nof conservation of energy is valid in\nall situations and for all kinds of\ntransformations.\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a height,\nh. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\npotential energy would decrease while the\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\nleast. However, the sum of the potential energy\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\nsame at all points. That is,\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\n or\n\nconstant.\n\nmgh +\nmv =\n(10.7)\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\nWe find that during the free fall of the object,\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\ntransformation of gravitational potential\nenergy into kinetic energy.\nReprint 2025-26",

If you move your\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\nalternatively, what will you observe?\n•\nIf you mark a dot on the slinky, you\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\nwill move back and forth parallel to\nthe direction of the propagation of the\ndisturbance.\nThe regions where the coils become closer\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\npropagates in the medium as a series of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\nThe particles do not move from one place to\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\nforth about their position of rest. This is\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\nThere is also another type of wave, called\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\nthe individual particles of the medium move\nabout their mean positions in a direction\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\nare not of the medium particles or their\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\nwave. You will come to know more about\ntransverse waves in higher classes.\n11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND\nWAVE\nWe can describe a sound wave by its\n•\nfrequency\n•\namplitude and\n•\nspeed.\nQ\nA sound wave in graphic form is shown in\nFig. 11.6(c), which represents how density and\npressure change when the sound wave moves\nin the medium. The density as well as the\npressure of the medium at a given time varies\nwith distance, above and below the average\nvalue of density and pressure.

This sound which we\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\nbetween the original sound and the\nreflected one must be at least 0.1s. If we\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\ngiven temperature, say at 22 ºC in air, the\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\nthe sound from the point of generation to\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\nsound must be half of this distance, that\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\nthe temperature of air. Echoes may be heard\nmore than once due to successive or\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\nis due to the successive reflections of the\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\naudible. The repeated reflection that\nresults in this persistence of sound is\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\nExample 11.2 A person clapped his hands\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.\nWhat is the distance of the cliff from the\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\nSolution:\nGiven,\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\nt = 2 s\nDistance travelled by the sound\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\ndistance between the cliff and the\nperson. Hence, the distance between the\ncliff and the person\n= 692 m/2 = 346 m.\nQ\nHorn\nMegaphone\nFig 11.10: A megaphone and a horn.\nuestion\n1.\nAn echo is heard in 3 s.

Different farmers thus have more\nor less land, money and access to information\nand technologies. In short, it is the money or\nfinancial conditions that allow farmers to take\nup different farming practices and agricultural\ntechnologies. There is a correlation between\nhigher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s\npurchasing capacity for inputs decides\ncropping system and production practices.\nTherefore, production practices can be at\ndifferent levels. They include ‘no cost’\nproduction, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high\ncost’ production practices.\n12.1.2 (i) NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\nJust as we need food for development, growth\nand well-being, plants also require nutrients\nfor growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants\nby air, water and soil. There are several\nnutrients which are essential for plants. Air\nsupplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes\nfrom water, and soil supplies the other thirteen\nnutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are\nrequired in large quantities and are therefore\ncalled macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are\nused by plants in small quantities and are\ntherefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1).\nQ\nReprint 2025-26",

Different farmers thus have more or less land, money and access to information and technologies. In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies. There is a correlation between higher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s purchasing capacity for inputs decides cropping system and production practices. Therefore, production practices can be at different levels. They include ‘no cost’ production, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high cost’ production practices."

Amongst these, some are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1)."

Brackish water\nresources, where seawater and fresh water\nmix together, such as estuaries and lagoons\nare also important fish reservoirs. While\ncapture fishing is also done in such inland\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\nproduction from these resources is through\naquaculture.\nFish culture is sometimes done in\ncombination with a rice crop, so that fish are\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. More\nintensive fish farming can be done in\ncomposite fish culture systems. Both local\nand imported fish species are used in such\nsystems.\nIn such a system, a combination of five or\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond.\nThese species are selected so that they do\nnot compete for food among them having\ndifferent types of food habits. As a result, the\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\nused. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\nand Common Carps are bottom feeders, and\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\npond without competing with each other. This\nincreases the fish yield from the pond.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFig. 12.6: (a) Catla (b) Silver carp (c) Rohu (d) Grass\nCarp (e) Mrigal (f) Common Carp\n(e)\n(f)\nOne problem with such composite fish\nculture is that many of these fish breed only\nduring monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected\nfrom the wild, it can be mixed with that of\nother species as well. So, a major problem in\nfish farming is the lack of availability of good-\nquality seed. To overcome this problem, ways\nhave now been worked out to breed these fish\nin ponds using hormonal stimulation. This\nhas ensured the supply of pure fish seed in\ndesired quantities.\nReprint 2025-26",

Yields are increased by locating large schools of fish in the open sea using satellites and echo-sounders. Some marine fish of high economic value are also farmed in seawater. This includes finned fishes like mullets, bhetki, and pearl spots, shellfish such as prawns (Fig. 12.5), mussels and oysters as well as seaweed. Oysters are also cultivated for the pearls they make.

        "text": "Fresh water resources include canals, ponds, reservoirs and rivers. Brackish water resources, where seawater and fresh water mix together, such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish reservoirs. While capture fishing is also done in such inland water bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish production from these resources is through aquaculture. Fish culture is sometimes done in combination with a rice crop, so that fish are grown in the water in the paddy field. More intensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems. Both local and imported fish species are used in such systems. In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fishpond. These species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them having different types of food habits. As a result, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used. As Catlas are surface feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps are bottom feeders, and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together these species (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other. This increases the fish yield from the pond. (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 12.6: (a) Catla (b) Silver carp (c) Rohu (d) Grass Carp (e) Mrigal (f) Common Carp (e) (f) One problem with such composite fish culture is that many of these fish breed only during monsoon. Even if fish seed is collected from the wild, it can be mixed with that of other species as well. So, a major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of good- quality seed. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish seed in desired quantities. Reprint 2025-26"
