Concern over rising pollution in our rivers led to the launching of various action plans to clean the rivers. Have you heard about such action plans? How does our health get affected by polluted river water? Think about “life of human beings without fresh water”. Arrange a debate on this topic in the class. National River Conservation Plan"

High mountains\nact as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may\nalso cause precipitation if they are high enough\nand lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The\nleeward side of mountains remains relatively dry.\nFACTORS AFFECTING INDIA’S CLIMATE\nLatitude\nThe Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle\nof the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the\nwest to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the\ncountry, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer,\nbelongs to the tropical area. All the remaining\narea, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics.\nTherefore, India’s climate has characteristics of\ntropical as well as subtropical climates.\nAltitude\nIndia has mountains to the north, which have\nan average height of about 6,000 metres. India\nalso has a vast coastal area where the\nmaximum elevation is about 30 metres. The\nHimalayas prevent the cold winds from Central\nAsia from entering the subcontinent. It is\nbecause of these mountains that this\nsubcontinent experiences comparatively\nmilder winters as compared to central Asia.\nPressure and Winds\nThe climate and associated weather conditions\nin India are governed by the following\natmospheric conditions:\n•\nPr\nPr\nPr\nPr\nPressur\nessur\nessur\nessur\nessure and sur\ne and sur\ne and sur\ne and sur\ne and surface winds;\nface winds;\nface winds;\nface winds;\nface winds;\n•\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\nUpper air circulation; and\n•\nW\nW\nW\nW\nWester\nester\nester\nester\nester n cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\nn cyclonic disturbances and\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones\ntropical cyclones.\nIndia lies in the region of north easterly\nwinds. These winds originate from the\nsubtropical high-pressure belt of the northern\ncoast gets a large portion of its rain during\nOctober and November.\n In general, coastal areas experience less\ncontrasts in temperature conditions. Seasonal\ncontrasts are more in the interior of the\ncountry. There is decrease in rainfall generally\nfrom east to west in the Northern Plains. These\nvariations have given rise to variety in lives of\npeople – in terms of the food they eat, the\nclothes they wear and also the kind of houses\nthey live in.\n•\nWhy the houses in Rajasthan have thick\nwalls and flat roofs?\n• Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region and\nin Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?\n• Why houses in Assam are built on stilts?\nCLIMATIC CONTROLS\nThere are six major controls of the climate of\nany place. They are: latitude, altitude,\npressure and wind system, distance from\nthe sea (continentality), ocean currents and\nrelief features.\nDue to the curvature of the earth, the\namount of solar energy received varies\naccording to latitude. As a result, air\ntemperature generally decreases from the\nequator towards the poles. As one goes from\nthe surface of the earth to higher altitudes,\nthe atmosphere becomes less dense and\ntemperature decreases. The hills are therefore\ncooler during summers. The pressure and\nwind system of any area depend on the\nlatitude and altitude of the place. Thus it\ninfluences the temperature and rainfall\npattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence\non climate: As the distance from the sea\nincreases, its moderating influence decreases\nand the people experience extreme weather\nconditions. This condition is known as\ncontinentality (i.e. very hot during summers\nand very cold during winters). Ocean currents\nalong with onshore winds affect the climate of\nthe coastal areas, For example, any coastal\narea with warm or cold currents flowing past\nit, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are\nonshore.\nReprint 2025-26",

They are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features. Due to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude. As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles. As one goes from the surface of the earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases. The hills are therefore cooler during summers. The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place. Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from the sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality (i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters). Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas, For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past it, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore.

The influence of the shifting of\nthe heat belt can be seen clearly from\ntemperature recordings taken during March-\nMay at different latitudes. In March, the highest\ntemperature is about 38° Celsius, recorded on\nthe Deccan plateau. In April, temperatures in\nGujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42°\nCelsius. In May, temperature of 45° Celsius is\ncommon in the northwestern parts of the\ncountry. In peninsular India, temperatures\nremain lower due to the moderating influence\nof the oceans.\nThe summer months experience rising\ntemperature and falling air pressure in the\nnorthern part of the country. Towards the end\nof May, an elongated low-pressure area\ndevelops in the region extending from the Thar\nDesert in the northwest to Patna and\nChotanagpur plateau in the east and\nsoutheast. Circulation of air begins to set in\naround this trough.\nA striking feature of the hot weather season\nis the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry\nwinds blowing during the day over the north\nand northwestern India. Sometimes they even\ncontinue until late in the evening. Direct\nexposure to these winds may even prove to be\nfatal. Dust storms are very common during the\nmonth of May in northern India. These storms\nbring temporary relief as they lower the\ntemperature and may bring light rain and cool\nbreeze. This is also the season for localised\nthunderstorms, associated with violent winds,\ntorrential downpours, often accompanied by\nhail. In West Bengal, these storms are known\nas the ‘Kaal Baisakhi’.\nTowards the close of the summer season,\npre-monsoon showers are common especially,\nin Kerala and Karnataka. They help in the early\nripening of mangoes, and are often referred to\nas ‘mango showers’.\nAdvancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)\nBy early June, the low-pressure condition over\nthe northern plains intensifies. It attracts, the\ntrade winds of the southern hemisphere. These\nsouth-east trade winds originate over the\nwarm subtropical areas of the southern oceans.\nThey cross the equator and blow in a south-\nwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula\nas the south-west monsoon. As these winds\nblow over warm oceans, they bring abundant\nmoisture to the subcontinent. These winds are\nstrong and blow at an average velocity of 30\nkm per hour. With the exception of the extreme\nnorth-west, the monsoon winds cover the\ncountry in about a month.\nThe inflow of the south-west monsoon into\nIndia brings about a total change in the\nweather. Early in the season, the windward\nside of the Western Ghats receives very heavy\nrainfall, more than 250 cm. The Deccan\nPlateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also\nreceive some amount of rain in spite of lying\nin the rain shadow area. The maximum rainfall\nof this season is received in the north-eastern\npart of the country. Mawsynram in the\nsouthern ranges of the Khasi Hills receives the\nhighest average rainfall in the world. Rainfall\nin the Ganga valley decreases from the east to\nthe west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get\nscanty rainfall.\nAnother phenomenon associated with the\nmonsoon is its tendency to have ‘breaks’ in\nrainfall. Thus, it has wet and dry spells. In\nother words, the monsoon rains take place\nonly for a few days at a time. They are\ninterspersed with rainless intervals. These\nbreaks in monsoon are related to the\nmovement of the monsoon trough. For\nvarious reasons, the trough and its axis keep\non moving northward or southward, which\ndetermines the spatial distribution of rainfall.\nWhen the axis of the monsoon trough lies over\nthe plains, rainfall is good in these parts.

It changes not only the population size but also the population composition of urban and rural populations in terms of age and sex composition. In India, the rural-urban migration has resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of population in cities and towns. The urban population has increased from 17.29 per cent of the total Reprint 2025-26"

    "raw_text": "Foreword\nThe National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s\nlife at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.\nWe hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of\na child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning.

        "text": "Foreword The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavor by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. NCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the Advisory Group on Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding the work of this committee.

The farmers in these regions set up tubewells for irrigation, and made use of HYV seeds, chemical fertilisers and pesticides in farming. Some of them bought farm machinery, like tractors and threshers, which made ploughing and harvesting faster. They were rewarded with high yields of wheat. In Palampur, the yield of wheat grown from the traditional varieties was 1300 kg per hectare. With HYV seeds, the yield went up to 3200 kg per hectare. There was a large increase in the production of wheat. Farmers now had greater amounts of surplus wheat to sell in the markets. Let’s Discuss"

Population becomes human capital when there is investment made in the form of education, training and medical care. In fact, human capital is the stock of skill and productive knowledge embodied in them. 'People as Resource' is a way of referring to a country’s working people in terms of their existing productive skills and abilities. Looking at the population from this productive aspect emphasises its ability to contribute to the creation of the Gross National Product. Like other resources population also is a resource — a 'human resource'. This is the positive side of a large population that is often overlooked when we look only at the negative side, considering only the problems of providing the population with food, education and access to health facilities. When the existing 'human resource' is further developed by becoming more educated and healthy, we call it 'human capital formation' that adds to the productive power of the country just like 'physical capital formation'. Investment in human capital (through education, training, medical care) yields a return just like investment in physical capital. This can be seen directly in the form of higher incomes earned because of higher productivity of the more educated or the better trained persons, as well as the higher productivity of healthier people.

They all wanted to have a better future for their children too. They requested the panchayat to open a school in the village. They assured the panchayat that they would all send their children to school. The panchayat, with the help of government, opened a school. A teacher was recruited from a nearby town. All the children of this village started going to school. After sometime one of the families gave training to his daughter in Moreover, the employment structure is characterised by self-employment in the primary sector. The whole family contributes in the field even though not everybody is really needed. So there is disguised unemployment in the agriculture sector. But the entire family shares what has been produced. This concept of sharing of work in the field and the produce raised reduces the hardship of unemployment in the rural sector. But this does not reduce the poverty of the family, gradually surplus labour from every household tends to migrate from the village in search of jobs. Let us discuss about the employment scenario in the three sectors mentioned earlier. Agriculture, is the most labour absorbing sector of the economy. In recent years, there has been a decline in the dependence of population on agriculture partly because of disguised unemployment discussed earlier. Some of the surplus labour in agriculture has moved to either Picture 2.6 Can you remember how much did you pay when you asked him to mend your shoes or slippers? Reprint 2025-26"

    "raw_text": "Economics\nPoverty Line\nAt the centre of the discussion on poverty\nis the concept of the ‘poverty line’. A\ncommon method used to measure poverty\nis based on the income or consumption\nlevels. The term ‘consumption’ means the\namount spent on various items such as\nfood, clothing, etc., by a family. A person\nis considered poor if his or her income or\nconsumption level falls below a given\n‘minimum level’ necessary to fulfill the\nbasic needs. What is necessary to satisfy\nbasic needs is different at different times\nand in different countries. Therefore,\npoverty line may vary with time and place.\nEach country uses an imaginary line that\nis considered appropriate for its existing\nlevel of development and its accepted\nminimum social norms. For example, a\nperson not having a car in the United\nStates may be considered poor. In India,\nowning a car is still considered a luxury.\nWhile determining the poverty line in\nIndia, till a few years ago, a minimum\nlevel of food requirement, clothing,\nfootwear, fuel and electricity, educational\nand medical needs, etc., were taken into\nconsideration. The physical quantities of\nthese needs were multiplied by their\nprices in rupees. The formula for food\nrequirement while estimating the\npoverty line was based on the desired\ncalorie requirement. Food items, such\nas cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, oil,\nsugar, etc., together provided these\nneeded calories. The calorie needs vary\ndepending on age, sex and the type of\nwork that a person does. The accepted\naverage calorie requirement in India was\n2400 calories per person per day in rural\nareas and 2100 calories per person per\nday in urban areas. Since people living\nin rural areas engage themselves in more\nphysical work, calorie requirements in\nrural areas were considered to be higher\nthan in urban areas. The bare monetary\nexpenditure per capita needed for\nbuying these calorie requirements in terms\nof food grains, etc., and reported by\nfamilies has been considered as poverty\nline. This amount was revised periodically,\ntaking into consideration the rise in prices.\nBased on the global developments, the\nGovernment of India has begun to\nestimate the proportion of poor in India\nusing 12 developmental indicators, which\nis popularly known as Multidimensional\nPoverty Index (see box). This national\nindex complements the income or\nconsumption expenditure based poverty\nmeasurement because it measures and\ncompares deprivations directly.\n Let’s Discuss\nDiscuss the following:\n•\nWhat could be the difference between\nconsumption based expenditure\nPoverty \nLine \nand \nNational\nMultidimensional Poverty Index?\n•\nWhat do you think would be the\n“minimum necessary level” in your\nlocality?\nPoverty Estimates\nBased on the methodology described in\nthe previous section, the number and\nproportion of poor people in India, called\nHead Count Ratio (HCR), is estimated.\nTable 3.1 shows that during the 1990s,\nthe \nproportion \nof \n‘consumption\nexpenditure based’ poor declined from\n45 to 37 per cent.

        "text": "Economics Poverty Line At the centre of the discussion on poverty is the concept of the ‘poverty line’. A common method used to measure poverty is based on the income or consumption levels. The term ‘consumption’ means the amount spent on various items such as food, clothing, etc., by a family. A person is considered poor if his or her income or consumption level falls below a given ‘minimum level’ necessary to fulfill the basic needs. What is necessary to satisfy basic needs is different at different times and in different countries. Therefore, poverty line may vary with time and place. Each country uses an imaginary line that is considered appropriate for its existing level of development and its accepted minimum social norms. For example, a person not having a car in the United States may be considered poor. In India, owning a car is still considered a luxury. While determining the poverty line in India, till a few years ago, a minimum level of food requirement, clothing, footwear, fuel and electricity, educational and medical needs, etc., were taken into consideration. The physical quantities of these needs were multiplied by their prices in rupees. The formula for food requirement while estimating the poverty line was based on the desired calorie requirement. Food items, such as cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, oil, sugar, etc., together provided these needed calories. The calorie needs vary depending on age, sex and the type of work that a person does. The accepted average calorie requirement in India was"

Since people living in rural areas engage themselves in more physical work, calorie requirements in rural areas were considered to be higher than in urban areas. The bare monetary expenditure per capita needed for buying these calorie requirements in terms of food grains, etc., and reported by families has been considered as poverty line. This amount was revised periodically, taking into consideration the rise in prices. Based on the global developments, the Government of India has begun to estimate the proportion of poor in India using 12 developmental indicators, which is popularly known as Multidimensional Poverty Index (see box). This national index complements the income or consumption expenditure based poverty measurement because it measures and compares deprivations directly. Let’s Discuss Discuss the following:"

American dollar is used by international agencies to compare data across countries. Although there has been a substantial reduction in global poverty, it is marked with great regional differences. Poverty declined substantially in China and Southeast Asian countries as a result of rapid economic growth and massive investments in human resource development (Read table 3.2 and graph"

    "raw_text": "Economics\nThe Challenges Ahead\nPoverty has certainly declined in India. But\ndespite the progress, poverty reduction\nremains India’s most compelling challenge.\nWide disparities in poverty are visible\nbetween rural and urban areas and\namong different States also. Certain social\nand economic groups are more vulnerable\nto poverty. Poverty reduction is expected\nto make better India. This would be\npossible mainly due to higher economic\ngrowth, increasing focus on universal\neducation, declining population growth;\nempowerment of the women and the\neconomically weaker sections of society\nwould also facilitate the same.\nThe income based definition of poverty\ncaptures only a limited part of what\npoverty really means to people. It is about\na ‘minimum’ subsistence level of living\nrather than a ‘reasonable’ level of living.\nMany scholars advocate that we must\nbroaden the concept into human poverty. A\nlarge number of people may have been able\nto feed themselves. But do they have\neducation? Or shelter? Or health care?\nOr job security? Or self-confidence? Are\nthey free from caste and gender\ndiscrimination? Is the practice of child\nlabour \nstill \ncommon? \nWorldwide\nexperience shows that with development,\nthe definition of what constitutes poverty\nalso changes. In this chapter we have\nlooked at the different approaches to\nmeasure \npoverty. \nThe \nNational\nMultidimensional Poverty Index put\nforward by NITI Aayog reveals that the\nnumber \nand \nproportion \nof\nmultidimensionally poor has declined in\nIndia. This may be due to the array of\nGovernment interventions initiated in\nrecent years. What do you think?\nPradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva\nAbhiyan was launched in 2016 with the aim\nto reduce maternal and infant mortality by\nproviding quality antenatal care to the\npregnant women throughout the country.\nThe scheme works towards safe\npregnancies, deliveries and addresses gaps\nin the service of the maternal care, to ensure\nconstant and regular treatment to the\nbeneficiaries. Services are provided on the\nninth day of every month. This programme\nfollows a systematic approach for\nengagement with private practitioners,\nmotivating them to volunteer in the scheme\nat government health facilities.\nPradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)\naims towards women empowerment in\nrural areas. It encourages the use of\nsmoke-free kitchen, thereby, saving them\nfrom chronic respiratory disorders and\npoor eye sights. It was launched in 2016\nwith an aim to provide clean cooking fuel\n(liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) to\neconomically poor households especially\nin the rural areas, who cook using\ntraditional methods by using either coal,\nwood or cow dungs. Its target beneficiaries\nare Below Poverty Line (BPL) households,\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,\nforest dwellers and marginalised group\nhouseholds.

        "text": "Economics The Challenges Ahead Poverty has certainly declined in India. But despite the progress, poverty reduction remains India’s most compelling challenge. Wide disparities in poverty are visible between rural and urban areas and among different States also. Certain social and economic groups are more vulnerable to poverty. Poverty reduction is expected to make better India. This would be possible mainly due to higher economic growth, increasing focus on universal education, declining population growth; empowerment of the women and the economically weaker sections of society would also facilitate the same. The income based definition of poverty captures only a limited part of what poverty really means to people. It is about a ‘minimum’ subsistence level of living rather than a ‘reasonable’ level of living. Many scholars advocate that we must broaden the concept into human poverty. A large number of people may have been able to feed themselves. But do they have education? Or shelter? Or health care? Or job security? Or self-confidence? Are they free from caste and gender discrimination? Is the practice of child labour still common? Worldwide experience shows that with development, the definition of what constitutes poverty also changes. In this chapter we have looked at the different approaches to measure poverty. The National Multidimensional Poverty Index put forward by NITI Aayog reveals that the number and proportion of multidimensionally poor has declined in India. This may be due to the array of Government interventions initiated in recent years. What do you think? Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan was launched in 2016 with the aim to reduce maternal and infant mortality by providing quality antenatal care to the pregnant women throughout the country. The scheme works towards safe pregnancies, deliveries and addresses gaps in the service of the maternal care, to ensure constant and regular treatment to the beneficiaries. Services are provided on the ninth day of every month. This programme follows a systematic approach for engagement with private practitioners, motivating them to volunteer in the scheme at government health facilities. Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) aims towards women empowerment in rural areas. It encourages the use of smoke-free kitchen, thereby, saving them from chronic respiratory disorders and poor eye sights. It was launched in 2016 with an aim to provide clean cooking fuel (liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) to economically poor households especially in the rural areas, who cook using traditional methods by using either coal, wood or cow dungs. Its target beneficiaries are Below Poverty Line (BPL) households, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, forest dwellers and marginalised group households. To encourage the use of LPG, the scheme provides a completely free connection, including the first refill and a stove. Over the years there is an increase in the LPG coverage throughout the country. Connections are issued in the name of the female member of the family. This scheme also promotes environment sustainability by reducing deforestation and carbon emission generated from burning coal and firewood. The use of clean cooking fuel, i.e., LPG means less time and effort in collecting firewood and encourages women to participate in social and economic activities. Reprint 2025-26"

Food security has following dimensions (a) availability of food means food production within the country, food imports and the previous years stock stored in government granaries. (b) accessibility means food is within reach of every person. (c) affordability implies that an individual has enough money to buy sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet one's dietary needs.

Due to a natural calamity, say drought, total production of foodgrains decreases. It creates a shortage of food in the affected areas. Due to shortage of food, the prices goes up. At the high prices, some people cannot afford to buy food. If such calamity happens in a very wide spread area or is stretched over a longer time period, it may cause a situation of starvation. A massive starvation might take a turn of famine. A Famine is characterised by wide spread deaths due to starvation and In the 1970s, food security was understood as the “availability at all times of adequate supply of basic foodstuffs” (UN, 1975). Amartya Sen added a new dimension to food security and emphasised the “access” to food through what he called ‘entitlements’ — a combination of what one can produce, exchange in the market alongwith state or other socially provided supplies. Accordingly, there has been a substantial shift in the understanding of food security. The 1995 World Food Summit declared, “Food security at the individual, household, regional, national and global levels exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 1996, p.3).

Write a note on the role of cooperatives in providing food and related items.\n Summary\nFood security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food\navailable, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there\nis no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food\ninsecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to\ncalamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition\ninsecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households\nin rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers\nengaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are\ndisproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically\nbackward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions\nmore prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of\nthe society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is\ncomposed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In\naddition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which\ncomprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated\nChild Development Services (ICDS); Food-for-Work (FFW); Mid-Day Meals; Antyodaya\nAnna Yojana (AAY) etc. In addition to the role of the government in ensuring food\nsecurity, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards\nthis direction.\nReprint 2025-26",

The people living below the poverty line might be food insecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to calamity or disaster. Although a large section of people suffer from food and nutrition insecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households in rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers engaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are disproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically backward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions more prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of the society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is composed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In addition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which comprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS); Food-for-Work (FFW); Mid-Day Meals; Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) etc. In addition to the role of the government in ensuring food security, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards this direction.

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number\nof teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book.

    "raw_text": "India and the Contemporary World\n\nIn 1774, Louis XVI of the Bourbon family of kings ascended the\nthrone of France. He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian\nprincess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found\nan empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial\nresources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an\nextravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis\nXVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their\nindependence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more\nthan a billion livres to a debt that had already risen to more than 2\nbillion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge\n10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged\nto spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments\nalone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining\nan army, the court, running government offices or universities, the\nstate was forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure would not\nhave sufficed. French society in the eighteenth century was divided\ninto three estates, and only members of the third estate paid taxes.\nThe society of estates was part of the feudal system that dated back to\nthe middle ages. The term Old Regime is usually used to describe the\nsociety and institutions of France before 1789.\nFig. 2 shows how the system of estates in French society was organised.\nPeasants made up about 90 per cent of the population. However,\nonly a small number of them owned the land they cultivated. About\n60 per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the Church and other\nricher members of the third estate.

    "raw_text": "Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\n\nActivity\n1.4 Support for Socialism\nBy the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate\ntheir efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the\nSecond International.\nWorkers in England and Germany began forming associations to\nfight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to\nhelp members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working\nhours and the right to vote.

Workers in England and Germany began forming associations to fight for better living and working conditions.

In Germany, these associations worked closely with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary seats.

In your report suggest what you\nthink the government should do to improve\nthe situation.\nFig.7 – Russian soldiers during the First\nWorld War.\nThe Imperial Russian army came to be known\nas the ‘Russian steam roller’. It was the\nlargest armed force in the world. When this\narmy shifted its loyalty and began supporting\nthe revolutionaries, Tsarist power collapsed.\nand the war was fought outside Europe as well as\nin Europe. This was the First World War.\nIn Russia, the war was initially popular and people\nrallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war\ncontinued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the\nmain parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. Anti-\nGerman sentiments ran high, as can be seen in the\nrenaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as\nPetrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German\norigins and poor advisers, especially a monk called\nRasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.\nThe First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed\nfrom that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies\nfought from trenches stretched along eastern\nFrance. In the east, armies moved a good deal and\nfought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were\nshocking and demoralising. Russia’s armies lost\nbadly in Germany and Austria between 1914 and\n1916. There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.\nAs they retreated, the Russian army destroyed\ncrops and buildings to prevent the enemy from\nbeing able to live off the land. The destruction of\ncrops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The\nsituation discredited the government and the Tsar. Soldiers did not\nwish to fight such a war.\nThe war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries\nwere few in number and the country was cut off from other suppliers\nof industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial\nequipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in\nEurope. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied\nmen were called up to the war.

The Imperial Russian army came to be known as the ‘Russian steam roller’. It was the largest armed force in the world. When this army shifted its loyalty and began supporting the revolutionaries, Tsarist power collapsed. and the war was fought outside Europe as well as in Europe. This was the First World War. In Russia, the war was initially popular and people rallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war continued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the main parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. Anti- German sentiments ran high, as can be seen in the renaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as Petrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German origins and poor advisers, especially a monk called Rasputin, made the autocracy unpopular. The First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed from that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies fought from trenches stretched along eastern France. In the east, armies moved a good deal and fought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were shocking and demoralising. Russia’s armies lost badly in Germany and Austria between 1914 and"

The war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries were few in number and the country was cut off from other suppliers of industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial equipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in Europe. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied men were called up to the war.

From: Fedor Belov, The History of a Soviet Collective Farm A member of a landowning family wrote to a relative about what happened at the estate: ‘The “coup” happened quite painlessly, quietly and peacefully. …The first days were unbearable.. Mikhail Mikhailovich [the estate owner] was calm...The girls also…I must say the chairman behaves correctly and even politely. We were left two cows and two horses. The servants tell them all the time not to bother us. “Let them live. We vouch for their safety and property. We want them treated as humanely as possible….” …There are rumours that several villages are trying to evict the committees and return the estate to Mikhail Mikhailovich. I don’t know if this will happen, or if it’s good for us. But we rejoice that there is a conscience in our people...’ From: Serge Schmemann, Echoes of a Native Land.

Non-Bolshevik socialists, liberals and supporters of autocracy condemned the Bolshevik uprising. Their leaders moved to south Russia and organised troops to fight the Bolsheviks (the ‘reds’). During 1918 and 1919, the ‘greens’ (Socialist Revolutionaries) and ‘whites’ (pro-Tsarists) controlled most of the Russian empire. They were backed by French, American, British and Japanese troops – all those forces who were worried at the growth of socialism in Russia. As these troops and the Bolsheviks fought a civil war, looting, banditry and famine became common. Supporters of private property among ‘whites’ took harsh steps with peasants who had seized land. Such actions led to the loss of popular support for the non-Bolsheviks. By January 1920, the Bolsheviks controlled most of the former Russian empire.

    "raw_text": "India and the Contemporary World\n\nBox 5\nExisting socialist parties in Europe did not wholly approve of the\nway the Bolsheviks took power – and kept it. However, the possibility\nof a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In\nmany countries, communist parties were formed – like the\nCommunist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged\ncolonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from\noutside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of\nthe East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international\nunion of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in\nthe USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By\nthe time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had\ngiven socialism a global face and world stature.\nYet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the\nstyle of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals\nof the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it\nwas recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward\ncountry had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture\nhad developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the\nessential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental\nprojects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth\ncentury, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist\ncountry had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals\nstill enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas\nof socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.\n5 The Global Influence of the Russian\nRevolution and the USSR\nWriting about the Russian Revolution in India\nAmong those the Russian Revolution inspired were many Indians. Several\nattended the Communist University. By the mid-1920s the Communist Party was\nformed in India.

        "text": "Box 5 Existing socialist parties in Europe did not wholly approve of the way the Bolsheviks took power – and kept it. However, the possibility of a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In many countries, communist parties were formed – like the Communist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged colonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from outside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of the East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international union of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in the USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By the time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had given socialism a global face and world stature. Yet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the style of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals of the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it was recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward country had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture had developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the essential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental projects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth century, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist country had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals still enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas of socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways."

This started a war with France and England. In September\n1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and\nJapan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to international power. Puppet\nregimes, supportive of Nazi Germany, were installed in a large\npart of Europe. By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of\nhis power.\nHitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering\nEastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space\nfor Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this\nhistoric blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British\naerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.\nThe Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat\non Germany at Stalingrad. After this the Soviet Red Army\nhounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the\nheart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern\nEurope for half a century thereafter.\nMeanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was\nunwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the\nFirst World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war\nfor long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied\nFrench Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in\nthe Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed\nthe US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World\nWar.

By the end of 1940, Hitler was at the pinnacle of his power. Hitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering Eastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space for Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this historic blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British aerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies. The Soviet Red Army inflicted a crushing and humiliating defeat on Germany at Stalingrad. After this the Soviet Red Army hounded out the retreating German soldiers until they reached the heart of Berlin, establishing Soviet hegemony over the entire Eastern Europe for half a century thereafter. Meanwhile, the USA had resisted involvement in the war. It was unwilling to once again face all the economic problems that the First World War had caused. But it could not stay out of the war for long. Japan was expanding its power in the east. It had occupied French Indo-China and was planning attacks on US naval bases in the Pacific. When Japan extended its support to Hitler and bombed the US base at Pearl Harbor, the US entered the Second World War. The war ended in May 1945 with Hitler’s defeat and the US dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima in Japan. From this brief account of what happened in the Second World War, we now return to Helmuth and his father’s story, a story of Nazi criminality during the war.

In non-violent technique, as I have said, there is no such thing as defeat. It is all ‘do or die’ without killing or hurting. It can be used practically without money and obviously without the aid of science of destruction which you have brought to such perfection. It is a marvel to me that you do not see that it is nobody’s monopoly. If not the British, some other power will certainly improve upon your method and beat you with your own weapon. You are leaving no legacy to your people of which they would feel proud. They cannot take pride in a recital of cruel deed, however skilfully planned. I, therefore, appeal to you in the name of humanity to stop the war…. I am, Your sincere friend,"

In 1896 the American writer, Richard Harding, wrote on the Honduras in Central America: ‘There is no more interesting question of the present day than that of what is to be done with the world’s land which is lying unimproved; whether it shall go to the great power that is willing to turn it to account, or remain with its original owner, who fails to understand its value. The Central Americans are like a gang of semi-barbarians in a beautifully furnished house, of which they can understand neither its possibilities of comfort nor its use.’ Three years later the American-owned United Fruit Company was founded, and grew bananas on an industrial scale in Central America. The company acquired such power over the governments of these countries that they came to be known as Banana Republics.

    "raw_text": "India and the Contemporary World\n\nBy the early nineteenth century, oak forests in England were\ndisappearing. This created a problem of timber supply for the Royal\nNavy. How could English ships be built without a regular supply of\nstrong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protected\nand maintained without ships? By the 1820s, search parties were\nsent to explore the forest resources of India. Within a decade, trees\nwere being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber\nwere being exported from India.\nThe spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand.\nRailways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of\nimperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and\nto lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together.\nEach mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers.\nFrom the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890,\nabout 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the\ntracks had increased to over 765,000 km. As the railway tracks spread\nthrough India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. As\nearly as the 1850s, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees were\nbeing cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contracts\nto individuals to supply the required quantities.

        "text": "By the early nineteenth century, oak forests in England were disappearing. This created a problem of timber supply for the Royal Navy. How could English ships be built without a regular supply of strong and durable timber? How could imperial power be protected and maintained without ships? By the 1820s, search parties were sent to explore the forest resources of India. Within a decade, trees were being felled on a massive scale and vast quantities of timber were being exported from India. The spread of railways from the 1850s created a new demand. Railways were essential for colonial trade and for the movement of imperial troops. To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel, and to lay railway lines sleepers were essential to hold the tracks together. Each mile of railway track required between 1,760 and 2,000 sleepers. From the 1860s, the railway network expanded rapidly. By 1890, about 25,500 km of track had been laid. In 1946, the length of the tracks had increased to over 765,000 km. As the railway tracks spread through India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. As early as the 1850s, in the Madras Presidency alone, 35,000 trees were being cut annually for sleepers. The government gave out contracts to individuals to supply the required quantities. These contractors began cutting trees indiscriminately. Forests around the railway tracks fast started disappearing. Fig.5 – Elephants piling squares of timber at a timber yard in Rangoon.

On the\nway they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping\ntheir summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended\nwith their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills.\nNext April, once again, they began their march with their goats and\nsheep, to the summer meadows.\nFurther to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders\ncame down to the dry forests of the bhabar in the\nwinter, and went up to the high meadows – the\nbugyals – in summer. Many of them were\noriginally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in\nthe nineteenth century in search of good pastures.\nThis pattern of cyclical movement between summer\nand winter pastures was typical of many pastoral\ncommunities of the Himalayas, including the\nBhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had\nto adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use\nof available pastures in different places. When the\npasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they\nmoved their herds and flock to new areas.

On the way they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping their summer harvest and sowing their winter crop. Then they descended with their flock to their winter grazing ground on the Siwalik hills. Next April, once again, they began their march with their goats and sheep, to the summer meadows. Further to the east, in Garhwal and Kumaon, the Gujjar cattle herders came down to the dry forests of the bhabar in the winter, and went up to the high meadows – the bugyals – in summer. Many of them were originally from Jammu and came to the UP hills in the nineteenth century in search of good pastures. This pattern of cyclical movement between summer and winter pastures was typical of many pastoral communities of the Himalayas, including the Bhotiyas, Sherpas and Kinnauris. All of them had to adjust to seasonal changes and make effective use of available pastures in different places. When the pasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they moved their herds and flock to new areas. This continuous movement also allowed the pastures to recover; it prevented their overuse.

They\nappointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were\nmade responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British\nimposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.\nConsequently, the traditional authority of both elders and\nwarriors was adversely affected.\nThe chiefs appointed by the colonial government often\naccumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with\nwhich they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent\nmoney to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many\nof them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.\nTheir wives and children stayed back in the villages to look\nafter the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the\ndevastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and\nnon-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock\nwas depleted.\nBut the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only\non their livestock was different.

        "text": "To administer the affairs of the Maasai, the British introduced a series of measures that had important implications. They appointed chiefs of different sub-groups of Maasai, who were made responsible for the affairs of the tribe. The British imposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare. Consequently, the traditional authority of both elders and warriors was adversely affected. The chiefs appointed by the colonial government often accumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with which they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent money to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many of them began living in towns, and became involved in trade. Their wives and children stayed back in the villages to look after the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the devastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and non-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock was depleted. But the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only on their livestock was different. Most often, they did not have the resources to tide over bad times. In times of war and famine, they lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work in the towns. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others did odd jobs.

We\nmust not accept something just because it is\nfamous, just because everyone accepts it.\nYolanda: Ma’am, can I suggest something? We don’t\nneed to look for any definition. I read somewhere\nthat the word democracy comes from a Greek\nword ‘Demokratia’. In Greek ‘demos’ means\npeople and ‘kratia’ means rule. So democracy is\nrule by the people. This is the correct meaning.\nWhere is the need to debate?\nLyngdoh Madam: That is also a very helpful way\nof thinking about this matter. I would just say\nthat this does not always work. A word does not\nremain tied to its origin. Just think of computers.\nOriginally they were used for computing, that is to\nsay calculating, very difficult mathematical sums.\nThese were very powerful calculators. But nowa-\ndays very few people use computers for comput-\ning sums. They use it for writing, for designing, for\nlistening to music and for watching films. Words\nremain the same but their meaning can change\nwith time. In that case it is not very useful to look\nat the origins of a word.\nMerry: Ma’am, so basically what you are saying\nis that there is no shortcut to our thinking about\nthe matter ourselves. We have to think about its\nmeaning and evolve a definition.\nLyngdoh Madam: You got me right. Let us get on\nwith it now.\nA C T I V I T Y\nLet us take Lyngdoh Madam seriously and try to\nwrite down the exact definition of some of the\nsimple words that we use all the time: pen, rain\nand love. For example, is there a way of defining a\npen that distinguishes it clearly from a pencil, a\nbrush, a chalk or crayon.\n< What have you learnt from this attempt?\n< What does it teach us about understanding the\nmeaning of democracy?\nA simple definition\nA simple definition\nA simple definition\nA simple definition\nA simple definition\nLet us get back to our discussion on\nsimilarities and differences among\ngovernments that are called\nYou have already read about different\nforms of government. On the basis of\nyour understanding of democracy\nso far, mentioning a few examples\nwrite down some common features of:\n< Democratic governments\n< Non-democratic governments\nWhy define democracy?\nWhy define democracy?\nWhy define democracy?\nWhy define democracy?\nWhy define democracy?\nBefore we proceed further, let us\nfirst take note of an objection by\nMerry. She does not like this way\nof defining democracy and wants\nto ask some basic questions.\nHer teacher Matilda Lyngdoh\nresponds to her questions, as other\nclassmates join the discussion:\nMerry: Ma’am, I don’t like this idea. First we spend\ntime discussing democracy and then we want\nto find out the meaning of democracy. I mean\nlogically shouldn’t we have approached it the\nother way round? Shouldn’t the meaning have\ncome first and then the example?\nLyngdoh Madam: I can see your point. But that is\nnot how we reason in everyday life. We use\nwords like pen, rain or love. Do we wait to have\na definition of these words before we use them?\nCome to think of it, do we have clear definition\nof these words? It is only by using a word that\nwe understand its meaning.\nMerry: But then why do we need definitions at all?\nLyngdoh Madam: We need a definition only when\nwe come across a difficulty in the use of a word.\nWe need a definition of rain only when we wish to\ndistinguish it from, say, drizzle or cloudburst. The\nsame is true for democracy. We need a clear\ndefinition only because people use it for different\npurposes, because very different kinds of gov-\nernments call themselves democracy.\nRibiang: But why do we need to work on a defini-\ntion? The other day you quoted Abraham\nLincoln to us: “Democracy is government of\nthe people, by the people and for the people”.\nWe in Meghalaya always ruled ourselves. That\nis accepted by everyone. Why do we need to\nchange that?\nLyngdoh Madam: I am not saying we need to\nchange it. I too find this definition very beautiful.\nReprint 2025-26",

Just think of computers. Originally they were used for computing, that is to say calculating, very difficult mathematical sums. These were very powerful calculators. But nowa- days very few people use computers for comput- ing sums. They use it for writing, for designing, for listening to music and for watching films. Words remain the same but their meaning can change with time. In that case it is not very useful to look at the origins of a word. Merry: Ma’am, so basically what you are saying is that there is no shortcut to our thinking about the matter ourselves. We have to think about its meaning and evolve a definition. Lyngdoh Madam: You got me right. Let us get on with it now."

Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Why define democracy? Before we proceed further, let us first take note of an objection by Merry. She does not like this way of defining democracy and wants to ask some basic questions. Her teacher Matilda Lyngdoh responds to her questions, as other classmates join the discussion: Merry: Ma’am, I don’t like this idea. First we spend time discussing democracy and then we want to find out the meaning of democracy. I mean logically shouldn’t we have approached it the other way round? Shouldn’t the meaning have come first and then the example? Lyngdoh Madam: I can see your point. But that is not how we reason in everyday life. We use words like pen, rain or love. Do we wait to have a definition of these words before we use them? Come to think of it, do we have clear definition of these words? It is only by using a word that we understand its meaning. Merry: But then why do we need definitions at all? Lyngdoh Madam: We need a definition only when we come across a difficulty in the use of a word. We need a definition of rain only when we wish to distinguish it from, say, drizzle or cloudburst. The same is true for democracy. We need a clear definition only because people use it for different purposes, because very different kinds of gov- ernments call themselves democracy. Ribiang: But why do we need to work on a defini- tion? The other day you quoted Abraham Lincoln to us: “Democracy is government of the people, by the people and for the people”. We in Meghalaya always ruled ourselves. That is accepted by everyone. Why do we need to change that? Lyngdoh Madam: I am not saying we need to change it. I too find this definition very beautiful.

Since then the country has been ruled by ZANU-PF, the party that led the freedom struggle. Its leader, Robert Mugabe, ruled the country since independence. Elections were held regularly and always won by ZANU-PF. President Mugabe was popular but also used unfair practices in elections. Over the years his government changed the constitution several times to increase the powers of the President and make him less accountable. Opposition party workers were harassed and their meeting disrupted. Public protests and demonstrations against the government were declared illegal. There was a law that limited the right to criticise the President. Television and radio were controlled by the government and gave only the ruling party’s version. There were independent newspapers but the government harassed those journalists who went against it. The government ignored some court judgments that went against it and pressurised judges. He was forced out of office in 2017. The example of Zimbabwe shows that popular approval of the rulers is necessary in a democracy, but it is not sufficient. Popular governments can be undemocratic.

They point out\nthat no large-scale famine has ever\ntaken place in an independent and\ndemocratic country. If China too had\nmultiparty elections, an opposition\nparty and a press free to criticise the\ngovernment, then so many people\nmay not have died in the famine.\nThis example brings out one of the\nreasons why democracy is considered\nthe best form of government.\nDemocracy is better than any other\nform of government in responding to\nthe needs of the people. A non-\ndemocratic government may and can\nrespond to the people’s needs, but it\nall depends on the wishes of the\npeople who rule. If the rulers don’t\nwant to, they don’t have to act\naccording to the wishes of the people.\nA democracy requires that the rulers\nhave to attend to the needs of the\npeople. A democratic government is\na better government because it is a\nmore \naccountable \nform \nof\ngovernment.\nThere is another reason why\ndemocracy should lead to better\ndecisions than any non-democratic\ngovernment. Democracy is based on\nconsultation and discussion. A\ndemocratic decision always involves\nmany persons, discussions and\nmeetings. When a number of people\nput their heads together, they are\nable to point out possible mistakes\nin any decision. This takes time. But\nthere is a big advantage in taking\ntime over important decisions. This\nreduces the chances of rash or\nirresponsible decisions. Thus\ndemocracy improves the quality\nof decision-making.\nThis is related to the third\nargument. Democracy provides a\nmethod to deal with differences\nand conflicts. In any society people\nare bound to have differences of\nopinions and interests. These\ndifferences are particularly sharp in\na country like ours which has an\namazing social diversity. People\nbelong to different regions, speak\ndifferent languages, practise\ndifferent religions and have different\ncastes. They look at the world very\ndifferently and have different\npreferences. The preferences of one\ngroup can clash with those of other\ngroups. How do we resolve such a\nconflict? The conflict can be solved\nby brutal power. Whichever group\nis more powerful will dictate its\nterms and others will have to accept\nthat.

The existence of democracy in India made the Indian government respond to food scarcity in a way that the Chinese government did not. They point out that no large-scale famine has ever taken place in an independent and democratic country. If China too had multiparty elections, an opposition party and a press free to criticise the government, then so many people may not have died in the famine. This example brings out one of the reasons why democracy is considered the best form of government. Democracy is better than any other form of government in responding to the needs of the people. A non- democratic government may and can respond to the people’s needs, but it all depends on the wishes of the people who rule. If the rulers don’t want to, they don’t have to act according to the wishes of the people. A democracy requires that the rulers have to attend to the needs of the people. A democratic government is a better government because it is a more accountable form of government. There is another reason why democracy should lead to better decisions than any non-democratic government. Democracy is based on consultation and discussion. A democratic decision always involves many persons, discussions and meetings. When a number of people put their heads together, they are able to point out possible mistakes in any decision.

The preferences of one group can clash with those of other groups. How do we resolve such a conflict? The conflict can be solved by brutal power. Whichever group is more powerful will dictate its terms and others will have to accept that. But that would lead to resentment and unhappiness. Different groups may not be able to live together for long in such a way. Democracy provides the only peaceful solution to this problem. In democracy, no one is a permanent winner. No one is a permanent loser. Different groups can live with one another peacefully. In a diverse country like India, democracy keeps our country together. These three arguments were about the effects of democracy on the quality of government and social life. But the strongest argument for democracy is not about what democracy does to the government. It is about what democracy does to the citizens. Even if democracy does not bring about better decisions and accountable government, it is still better than other forms of government. Democracy enhances the dignity of citizens. As we discussed above, democracy is based on the principle of political equality, on recognising that the What would have happened if India was not a democracy?

But\nall countries that are democratic will\nhave constitutions. After the War of\nIndependence against Great Britain,\nthe Americans gave themselves a\nconstitution. After the Revolution, the\nFrench people approved a democratic\nconstitution.

Constitution making is not unique to South Africa. Every country has diverse groups of people. Their relationship may not have been as bad as that between the whites and the blacks in South Africa. But all over the world people have differences of opinion and interests. Whether democratic or not, most countries in the world need to have these basic rules. This applies not just to governments. Any association needs to have its constitution. It could be a club in your area, a cooperative society or a political party, they all need a constitution."

Are these rules in accordance with principles of democracy? Do they give membership to any person without discrimination? Thus, the constitution of a country is a set of written rules that are accepted by all people living together in a country. Constitution is the supreme law that determines the relationship among people living in a territory (called citizens) and also the relationship between the people and government. A constitution does many things: < First, it generates a degree of trust and coordination that is necessary for different kind of people to live together; < Second, it specifies how the government will be constituted, who will have power to take which decisions; < Third, it lays down limits on the powers of the government and tells us what the rights of the citizens are; and < Fourth, it expresses the aspirations of the people about creating a good society. All countries that have constitutions are not necessarily democratic. But all countries that are democratic will have constitutions. After the War of Independence against Great Britain, the Americans gave themselves a constitution. After the Revolution, the French people approved a democratic constitution. Since then it has become a practice in all democracies to have a written constitution. This is not fair! What was the point in having a Constituent Assembly in India if all the basics were already decided? Reprint 2025-26"

It contains the philosophy on which the entire Constitution has been built. It provides a standard to examine and evaluate any law and action of government, to find out whether it is good or bad. It is the soul of the Indian Constitution. Note: *The terms ‘Socialist’ and ‘Secular’ were added in Preamble through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment in 1976. Reprint 2025-26"

As we noted above, a constitution is mainly about embodying these values into institutional arrangements. Much of the document called Constitution of India is about these arrangements. It is a very long and detailed document. Therefore it needs to be amended quite regularly to keep it updated. Those who crafted the Indian Constitution felt that it has to be in accordance with people’s aspirations and changes in society. They did not see it as a sacred, static and unalterable law. So, they made provisions to incorporate changes from time to time. These changes are called constitutional amendments. The Constitution describes the institutional arrangements in a very legal language. If you read the Constitution for the first time, it can be quite difficult to understand. Yet the basic institutional design is not very difficult to understand. Like any Constitution, the Indian Constitution lays down a procedure for choosing persons to govern the country. It defines who will have how much power to take which decisions. And it puts limits to what the government can do by providing some rights to the citizen that cannot be violated. The remaining three chapters in this book are about these three aspects of the working of Indian constitution. We shall look at some key constitutional provisions in each chapter and understand how they work in democratic politics. But this textbook will not cover all the salient features of the institutional design in the Indian Constitution. Some other aspects will be covered in your textbook next year. Apartheid: The official policy of racial separation and ill treatment of blacks followed by the government of South Africa between 1948 and 1989. Clause: A distinct section of a document. Constituent Assembly: An assembly of people’s representatives that writes a constitution for a country. Constitution: Supreme law of a country, containing fundamental rules governing the politics and society in a country. Constitutional amendment: A change in the constitution made by the supreme legislative body in a country. Draft: A preliminary version of a legal document. Philosophy: The most fundamental principles underlying one’s thoughts and actions. Preamble: An introductory statement in a constitution which states the reasons and guiding values of the constitution. Treason: The offence of attempting to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance. Tryst: A meeting or meeting place that has been agreed upon."

The most common form of\ndemocracy in our times is for the people to govern through their\nrepresentatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives\nare elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and\nuseful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition\namong parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an\nelection democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic\nelections from non-democratic elections.\nThe rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of\nthis yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing\nof boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At\neach stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.\nTowards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether\nelections in India are free and fair.

The people were unhappy with the existing government. They were also attracted by Devi Lal’s promise. So, when elections were held, they voted overwhelmingly in favour of Lok Dal and its allies. Lok Dal and its partners won 76 out of 90 seats in the State Assembly. Lok Dal alone won 60 seats and thus had a clear majority in the Assembly. The Congress could win only 5 seats. Once the election results were announced, the sitting Chief Minister resigned. The newly elected Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of Lok Dal chose Devi Lal as their leader. The Governor invited Devi Lal to be the new Chief Minister. Three days after the election results were declared, he became the Chief Minister. As soon as he became the Chief Minister, his Government issued a Government Order waiving the outstanding loans of small farmers, agricultural labourers and small businessmen. His party ruled the State for four years. The next elections were held in 1991. But this time his party did not win popular support. The Congress won the election and formed the government.

That day is usually called the election day. Every person whose name is on the voters’ list can go to a nearby ‘polling booth’, situated usually in a local school or a government office. Once the voter goes inside the booth, the election officials identify her, put a mark on her finger and allow her to cast her vote. An agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way."

For instance, the government spent about `3,500 crores in conducting Lok Sabha elections in 2014. That works out to about `40 per person on the voters’ list. The amount spent by parties and candidates was more than what the government spent. Roughly speaking, the expenditure made by government, parties and candidates was around `30,000 crores or `500 per voter.

They have to work\nwith and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such\ninstitutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the\nmanner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our\ncountry. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are\nresolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key\nrole in major decisions – legislature, executive and judiciary.\nYou have already read something about these institutions in earlier\nclasses. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking\nlarger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this\ninstitution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?\nWhat makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective\nhere is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the\nwork of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions\nin other democracies.

Governing a\ncountry involves various such\nactivities. \nFor \nexample, \nthe\ngovernment is responsible for\nensuring security to the citizens and\nproviding facilities for education\nand health to all. It collects taxes\nand spends the money thus raised\non administration, defence and\ndevelopment \nprogrammes. \nIt\nformulates and implements several\nwelfare schemes. Some persons have\nto take decisions on how to go about\nthese activities. Others have to\nimplement these decisions. If\ndisputes arise on these decisions or\nin their implementation, there should\nbe someone to determine what is\nright and what is wrong. It is\nimportant that everyone should\nknow who is responsible for doing\nwhat. It is also important that these\nactivities keep taking place even if\nthe persons in key positions change.\nSo, to attend to all these tasks,\nseveral arrangements are made in\nall modern democracies. Such\narrangements are called institutions.\nA democracy works well when these\ninstitutions perform functions\nassigned to them. The Constitution\nof any country lays down basic\nrules on the powers and functions\nof each institution. In the example\nabove, we saw several such\ninstitutions at work.\n< The Prime Minister and the\nCabinet are institutions that take\nall important policy decisions.\n< The Civil Servants, working\ntogether, are responsible for\ntaking steps to implement the\nministers’ decisions.\n< Supreme Court is an institution\nwhere disputes between citizens\nand the government are finally\nsettled.\nCan you think of some other insti-\ntutions in this example? What is\ntheir role?\nWorking with institutions is not\neasy. Institutions involve rules and\nregulations. This can bind the hands\nof leaders. Institutions involve\nmeetings, committees and routines.\nThis often leads to delays and\ncomplications. Therefore dealing\nwith institutions can be frustrating.\nOne might feel that it is much better\nto have one person take all decisions\nwithout any rules, procedures and\nmeetings. But that is not the spirit\nof democracy. Some of the delays\nand complications introduced by\ninstitutions are very useful.

NNNNNee eeee eeeed f d f d f d f d for P or P or P or P or Political Institutions olitical Institutions olitical Institutions olitical Institutions olitical Institutions We have seen one example of how the government works. Governing a country involves various such activities. For example, the government is responsible for ensuring security to the citizens and providing facilities for education and health to all. It collects taxes and spends the money thus raised on administration, defence and development programmes. It formulates and implements several welfare schemes. Some persons have to take decisions on how to go about these activities. Others have to implement these decisions. If disputes arise on these decisions or in their implementation, there should be someone to determine what is right and what is wrong. It is important that everyone should know who is responsible for doing what. It is also important that these activities keep taking place even if the persons in key positions change. So, to attend to all these tasks, several arrangements are made in all modern democracies. Such arrangements are called institutions. A democracy works well when these institutions perform functions assigned to them. The Constitution of any country lays down basic rules on the powers and functions of each institution. In the example above, we saw several such institutions at work. < The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are institutions that take all important policy decisions. < The Civil Servants, working together, are responsible for taking steps to implement the ministers’ decisions. < Supreme Court is an institution where disputes between citizens and the government are finally settled. Can you think of some other insti- tutions in this example? What is their role? Working with institutions is not easy. Institutions involve rules and regulations. This can bind the hands of leaders. Institutions involve meetings, committees and routines. This often leads to delays and complications. Therefore dealing with institutions can be frustrating. One might feel that it is much better to have one person take all decisions without any rules, procedures and meetings. But that is not the spirit of democracy. Some of the delays and complications introduced by institutions are very useful. They provide an opportunity for a wider set of people to be consulted in any decision.

Political leaders\nwho take the big decisions fall in this\ncategory. In the second category,\npeople are appointed on a long-term\nbasis. This is called the permanent\nexecutive or civil services. Persons\nworking in civil services are called\ncivil servants. They remain in office\neven when the ruling party changes.\nThese officers work under political\nexecutive and assist them in\ncarrying out the day-to-day\nadministration. Can you recall the\nrole of political and non-political\nexecutive in the case of the Office\nMemorandum?\nYou might ask: Why does the\npolitical executive have more power\nthan the non-political executive?\nWhy is the minister more powerful\nthan the civil servant? The civil\nservant is usually more educated\nand has more expert knowledge of\nthe subject. The advisors working in\nthe Finance Ministry know more\nabout economics than the Finance\nMinister. Sometimes the ministers\nmay know very little about the\ntechnical matters that come under\ntheir ministry. This could easily\nhappen in ministries like Defence,\nIndustry, Health, Science and\nTechnology, Mines, etc. Why should\nthe minister have the final say on\nthese matters?\nThe reason is very simple. In a\ndemocracy the will of the people is\nsupreme. The minister is an elected\nrepresentative of the people and\nthus empowered to exercise the will\nof the people on their behalf. She is\nfinally answerable to the people for\nall the consequences of her\ndecision. That is why the minister\ntakes all the final decisions. The\nminister decides the overall\nframework and objectives in which\ndecisions on policy should be\nmade. The minister is not, and is not\nexpected to be, an expert in the\nmatters of her ministry. The\nminister takes the advice of experts\non all technical matters. But very\noften experts hold different opinions\nor place before her more than one\noption. Depending on what the\noverall objective is, the minister\ndecides.\nActually this happens in any large\norganisation. Those who understand\nthe overall picture take the most\nReprint 2025-26",

PPPPPolitical and P olitical and P olitical and P olitical and P olitical and Pererererermanen manen manen manen manenttttt EEEEExxxxxeeeeecccccutiv utiv utiv utiv utiveeeee In a democratic country, two categories make up the executive. One that is elected by the people for a specific period, is called the political executive. Political leaders who take the big decisions fall in this category. In the second category, people are appointed on a long-term basis. This is called the permanent executive or civil services. Persons working in civil services are called civil servants. They remain in office even when the ruling party changes. These officers work under political executive and assist them in carrying out the day-to-day administration. Can you recall the role of political and non-political executive in the case of the Office Memorandum? You might ask: Why does the political executive have more power than the non-political executive? Why is the minister more powerful than the civil servant? The civil servant is usually more educated and has more expert knowledge of the subject. The advisors working in the Finance Ministry know more about economics than the Finance Minister. Sometimes the ministers may know very little about the technical matters that come under their ministry. This could easily happen in ministries like Defence, Industry, Health, Science and Technology, Mines, etc. Why should the minister have the final say on these matters? The reason is very simple. In a democracy the will of the people is supreme. The minister is an elected representative of the people and thus empowered to exercise the will of the people on their behalf. She is finally answerable to the people for all the consequences of her decision. That is why the minister takes all the final decisions. The minister decides the overall framework and objectives in which decisions on policy should be made. The minister is not, and is not expected to be, an expert in the matters of her ministry. The minister takes the advice of experts on all technical matters. But very often experts hold different opinions or place before her more than one option. Depending on what the overall objective is, the minister decides. Actually this happens in any large organisation. Those who understand the overall picture take the most Reprint 2025-26"

All the\ncourts at different levels in a country\nput together are called the judiciary.\nThe Indian judiciary consists of a\nSupreme Court for the entire nation,\nHigh Courts in the states, District\nCourts and the courts at local level.\nIndia has an integrated judiciary. It\nmeans the Supreme Court controls\nthe judicial administration in the\ncountry. Its decisions are binding on\nall other courts of the country. It can\ntake up any dispute\n< Between citizens of the country;\n< Between citizens and government;\n< Between two or more state\ngovernments; and\n< Between governments at the union\nand state level.\nIt is the highest court of appeal in\ncivil and criminal cases. It can hear\nappeals against the decisions of the\nHigh Courts.\nIndependence of the judiciary\nmeans that it is not under the\ncontrol of the legislature or the\nexecutive. The judges do not act on\nthe direction of the government or\naccording to the wishes of the party\nin power.

What was the reason? This is why an independent and powerful judiciary is considered essential for democracies. All the courts at different levels in a country put together are called the judiciary. The Indian judiciary consists of a Supreme Court for the entire nation, High Courts in the states, District Courts and the courts at local level. India has an integrated judiciary. It means the Supreme Court controls the judicial administration in the country. Its decisions are binding on all other courts of the country. It can take up any dispute < Between citizens of the country; < Between citizens and government; < Between two or more state governments; and < Between governments at the union and state level. It is the highest court of appeal in civil and criminal cases. It can hear appeals against the decisions of the High Courts. Independence of the judiciary means that it is not under the control of the legislature or the executive. The judges do not act on the direction of the government or according to the wishes of the party in power. That is why all modern democracies have courts that are independent of the legislature and the executive. India has achieved this.

It\nmeans that the laws apply in the same\nmanner to all, regardless of a person’s\nstatus. This is called the rule of law.\nRule of law is the foundation of any\ndemocracy. It means that no person\nis above the law. There cannot be any\ndistinction between a political leader,\ngovernment official and an ordinary\ncitizen.\nEvery citizen, from the Prime\nMinister to a small farmer in a remote\nvillage, is subjected to the same laws.\nNo person can legally claim any\nspecial treatment or privilege just\nbecause he or she happens to be an\nimportant person. For example, a few\nyears ago a former Prime Minister of\nthe country faced a court case on\ncharges of cheating. The court finally\ndeclared that he was not guilty. But\nas long as the case continued, he had\nto go to the court, give evidence and\nfile papers, just like any other citizen.\nThis basic position is further\nclarified in the Constitution by\nspelling out some implications of the\nRight to Equality. The government\nshall not discriminate against any\ncitizen on grounds only of religion,\nrace, caste, sex or place of birth. Every\ncitizen shall have access to public\nplaces like shops, restaurants, hotels,\nand cinema halls. Similarly, there\nshall be no restriction with regard to\nthe use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats,\nroads, playgrounds and places of\npublic resorts maintained by\ngovernment or dedicated to the use\nof general public. This might appear\nvery obvious, but it was necessary to\nDEMOCRATIC RIGHTS\nIn \nIndia, \nlike \nmost \nother\ndemocracies in the world, these\nrights are mentioned in the\nConstitution.

It means that the laws apply in the same manner to all, regardless of a person’s status. This is called the rule of law. Rule of law is the foundation of any democracy. It means that no person is above the law. There cannot be any distinction between a political leader, government official and an ordinary citizen. Every citizen, from the Prime Minister to a small farmer in a remote village, is subjected to the same laws. No person can legally claim any special treatment or privilege just because he or she happens to be an important person. For example, a few years ago a former Prime Minister of the country faced a court case on charges of cheating. The court finally declared that he was not guilty. But as long as the case continued, he had to go to the court, give evidence and file papers, just like any other citizen. This basic position is further clarified in the Constitution by spelling out some implications of the Right to Equality. The government shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth. Every citizen shall have access to public places like shops, restaurants, hotels, and cinema halls. Similarly, there shall be no restriction with regard to the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads, playgrounds and places of public resorts maintained by government or dedicated to the use of general public. This might appear very obvious, but it was necessary to"

    "raw_text": "FOREWORD\nThe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This\nprinciple marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home\nand community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in\nthe National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that given\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is\npossible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\ndays is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book.

Syllabi of Civics in our country\ntend to focus on formal institutions of government. The textbooks are full of\nconstitutional, legal and procedural details, presented in a dry and abstract\nmanner. No wonder children experience disconnect between the theory they\nread in the textbook and what they see in real life around them. This is\nperhaps what makes Civics ‘boring’ for young adults in a country otherwise\nfull of passion for politics.\nThe present textbook is a small step towards changing this. The impetus\ncame from the National Curriculum Framework 2005 that provided the space\nand opportunity to bring about this basic change. The foreword to this book\nby the Director of the NCERT explains the philosophy of the new curriculum.\nIt meant a complete overhaul of the traditional Civics syllabi. The change in\nthe name – from Civics to Political Science – reflects the shift in the focus. The\nnew syllabi recognise that the student at this stage is aware of and needs to\nknow more about politics. Accordingly, the students in classes IX and X will\nbe offered an introduction to various facets of politics. Democracy is the\nwindow through which they get to look at the theory and the practice of\npolitics.\nWith this textbook you are going to take the students on a tour of a\nmuseum of contemporary democracy. You will first take them quickly\nthrough a series of stories from different parts of the world. Once they develop\na sense and feel of democracy, you can ask some reflective questions: what\nis democracy? Why democracy? With this clarity you can take them to a\ngallery on constitutions. An understanding of what and how of the\nconstitutions would prepare them for an exhibition on three aspects of\ndemocratic politics: elections, institutions and rights. You may encounter\nmany contentious themes during this tour. Our attempt here is not to hand\nover a definite opinion to the students but to enable them to think on their\nown.\nThis textbook is meant to help the students enjoy this tour and to assist\nyou in guiding them.
