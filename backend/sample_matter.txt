Chapter 1: Matter in Our Surroundings

Physical Nature of Matter
• Matter is made up of particles.
• The particles of matter are very small – beyond our imagination.

Characteristics of Particles of Matter
• Particles of matter have space between them.
• Particles of matter are continuously moving.
• Particles of matter attract each other.

States of Matter
Matter exists in three states: Solid, Liquid, and Gas.

1. The Solid State
• Solids have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compressibility.
• Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside force.
• Solids may break under force but it is difficult to change their shape, so they are rigid.

2. The Liquid State
• Liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume.
• They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept.
• Liquids flow and change shape, so they are not rigid but can be called fluid.
• The rate of diffusion of liquids is higher than that of solids.

3. The Gaseous State
• Gases are highly compressible as compared to solids and liquids.
• Due to high speed of particles and large space between them, gases show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases.

Effect of Change of Temperature
• On increasing the temperature of solids, the kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed.
• The temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point.
• The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion.
• The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point.
• Latent heat of vaporization is the heat energy required to change 1 kg of a liquid to gas at atmospheric pressure at its boiling point.
• Sublimation: A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called sublimation (e.g., Camphor).

Effect of Change of Pressure
• Applying pressure and reducing temperature can liquefy gases.
• Solid carbon dioxide (CO2) is stored under high pressure. It converts directly to gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice.

Evaporation
• The phenomenon of change of a liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation.
• Factors affecting evaporation:
  - An increase of surface area increases evaporation.
  - An increase of temperature increases evaporation.
  - A decrease in humidity increases evaporation.
  - An increase in wind speed increases evaporation.
• Evaporation causes cooling.
